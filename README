4/1/04: Modifications from /home/tgcm/tiegcm1/modsrc (tag tiegcm1-5)

4/13/04 btf: 
  Attempting to compile with pgf90 on hao Linux suncat machine.
  See new "Linux" entry in Makefile. Changes to several source files,
    mostly related to compiling without MPI. See new fpp macro "LINUX".

4/28/04 btf:
  This code is now working on both hao Linux and scd IBM systems.
  It is running serially on Linux suncat. There are differences
  in results between the 2 systems, but they are mostly small, and
  appear to get smaller with longer runs (e.g., diffs were consistently
  smaller after a 1-day run than after a 1-hour run). This code is
  also running on SGI dataproc, but has not been extensively tested.

5/7/04 btf:
  Simplified idynamo and potential_model namelist input logic in 
  advance.F using case statement.

  Weimer potential model apparently not working: sub setmodel01 produces
  NaNs for Coef(), see weimgcm01.F. Turned WEIMER off in input.F. 

  Added ZMAG as mandatory magnetic secondary history field. 
  See zpotenm3d -- the addfsech calls for ZMAG are in transf and
  transf_dyn0 (both in dynamo.F).

5/10/04: Committing this to cvs repository and tagging as tiegcm1-6.
