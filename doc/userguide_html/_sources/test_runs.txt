Version Benchmark Test Runs
===========================

A series of benchmark runs are made for each version release of the TIEGCM.
Job scripts and namelist input files for these runs are available in the
"tests" directory under the model root directory.

For version |version|, the following runs were made:

  * Steady-state seasonal runs (start-up histories and 5-day control runs)
    at solar minimum and solar maximum conditions:

    * March Equinox (day 80) 

    * June Solstice (day 172) 

    * September Equinox (day 264) 

    * December Solstice (day 355)

  * Full-year Climatology:

    * Heelis potential model with constant solar forcing

  * December, 2006 "AGU" storm case:

    * Heelis potential model with GPI (Kp) data

    * Weimer potential model with IMF data (F10.7 from GPI)
