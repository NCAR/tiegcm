<body><h3>
<hr>
Bug fixes:
<ul>

  <li>
    qinite.F : increase night-time ionization rates which is necessary
    because the minimum electron density was removed in previous versions
    (elden.F)
  </li>

  <li>
    dynamo.F subroutine threed: the E_lam wasn't mapped in the horizontal
    plane which gave wrong results close to the geomagnetic equator at
    higher pressure levels (as a consequence EXB drift was wrong)
  </li>

  <li>
    efield.F in the mapping from magnetic to geographic grid real values
    are put into integer w/o explicit conversion from real to integer.
    This led to wrong mapping on 64-bit Linux systems.
  </li>

  <li>
    addiag.F: Use glat(j) instead of float(j) in calculation of c2, sub calczg.
    Sub calczg calculates gravity-varying geopotential (geometric height) 
    field ZG.
  </li>

  <li>
    fft9.F: Add ntrigs argument to FFT99B call from sub FFT99
  </li>

  <li>
    Weimer05 model:wei05sc.F: Fix error in f90 translation in sub interpol_quad 
      (see comments in wei05sc.F). Also add routines to work around non-ANSI 
      trig functions.
  </li>
</ul>
     
<hr>
New namelist read parameter KP:
<ul>
  <li> KP can be specified either as a constant or multiple time-dependent values.</li>
  <li> If provided, empirical formulas will use the given KP to calculate CTPOTEN 
       and/or POWER.
  </li> 
</ul>

<hr>
Change calculation of the sun's location from dipole coordinates to apex.
<ul>
  <li>Update IGRF coefficients with IGRF11 in apex_subs.F</li>
</ul>

<hr>
Option to write 4-byte floats or 8-byte doubles to secondary histories:
<ul>
  <li>New namelist input parameter SECH_NBYTE can be either 4 (to write
      4-byte floats), or 8 (to write 8-byte doubles). Default is SECH_NBYTE = 4
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>
Script changes to enable parallel runs on hao 64-bit Linux systems:
<ul>
  <li> Changes to tiegcm-linux.job and tgcm_config in the scripts directory.
  <li> Add PGI/pgf90 MPI env vars to tiegcm-linux.job
  <li> To build and execute an MPI run on a 64-bit Linux machine, set the 
      following in tiegcm-linux.job:</li>
    <ul>
       <li> set mpi = TRUE </li>
       <li> set nproc = 4 or 8 </li>
       <li>Then execute "tiegcm-linux.job >! tiegcm-linux.out" as usual.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<hr>
Minor changes to scripts/tiegcm-ibm.job to accomodate mpi=FALSE under AIX.
<ul>
  <li>Also minor change to imf.F for the same reason (4-byte vs 8-byte integers).</li>
</ul>

<hr>
Year-end runs:
<ul>
  <li> Run to model time 366,0,0 (for non-leap years), or to 367,0,0 (for leap years)
    This will be written to the history files as mtime 1,0,0 of the next year.
    The 1,0,0 history can be used as the Source to start the following year.
  </li>
</ul>
