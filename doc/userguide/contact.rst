===================

The TIEGCM and related Thermosphere-Ionosphere models have been developed
by the "Atmosphere Ionosphere Magnetosphere" (AIM) Section of the High Altitude
Observatory (HAO) at NCAR (see http://www.hao.ucar.edu/modeling/tgcm).

For more information, questions or problems about the models, please
