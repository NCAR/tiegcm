===================

The TIEGCM and related Thermosphere-Ionosphere models have been developed
by the "Atmosphere Ionosphere Magnetosphere" (AIM) Section of the High Altitude
Observatory (HAO) at NCAR (see http://www.hao.ucar.edu/modeling/tgcm).

For more information, questions or problems about the models, please
subscribe to the moderated email list
`tgcmgroup@ucar.edu <http://mailman.ucar.edu/mailman/listinfo/tgcmgroup>`_.

For questions and information regarding the physics and chemistry implementation
of the model, numerical algorithms, and analysis of model results, you may also
contact any of the following HAO scientists:

 * Art Richmond (richmond@ucar.edu): upper atmosphere dynamics and electrodynamics
 * Stan Solomon (stans@ucar.edu): airglow, ionosphere chemistry
 * Astrid Maute (maute@ucar.edu): tidal dynamics and electro-dynamo code
 * Wenbin Wang (wbwang@ucar.edu): mesoscale processes, model coupling
 * Liying Qian (lqian@ucar.edu): neutral density, solar irradiance 
 * Alan Burns (aburns@ucar.edu): thermosphere dynamics and composition
