===================

The TIEGCM and related Thermosphere-Ionosphere models have been developed
by the "Atmosphere Ionosphere Magnetosphere" (AIM) Section of the High Altitude
Observatory (HAO) at NCAR.

For information and assistance regarding the software (source code and supporting
script infrastructure, including building and executing the models and using the 
post-processors, you may contact Ben Foster at foster@ucar.edu.

For questions and information regarding the physics and chemistry implementation
of the model, numerical algorithms, and analysis of model results, you may contact
any of the following HAO scientists:

 * Art Richmond (richmond@ucar.edu): upper atmospheric dynamics and electrodynamics.
 * Stan Solomon (stans@ucar.edu): airglow, ionosphere chemistry.
 * Hanli Liu (liuh@ucar.edu): tidal and gravity wave parameterization. 
 * Barbara Emery (emery@ucar.edu): auroral processes and parameterization.
 * Astrid Maute (maute@ucar.edu): electro-dynamo code.
 * Wenbin Wang (wbwang@ucar.edu): mesoscale processes, model coupling
 * Liying Qian (lqian@ucar.edu): ionosphere chemistry, global mean "column" model
