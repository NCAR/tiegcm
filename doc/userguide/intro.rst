Introduction
============

The NCAR/HAO Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model, 
or TIEGCM, is a three-dimensional, time-dependent, numeric simulation model of 
the Earth's upper atmosphere, including the upper Stratosphere, Mesosphere and 
Thermosphere.

This document is intended to assist members of the upper atmosphere research
community in building, executing, and visualizing the TIEGCM as an integral
part of their research.  We also welcome development efforts on the model
itself, subject to the Academic Research License Agreement
