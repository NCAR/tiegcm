New validated features in the public release:

  - Weimer 2005 electric potential model, optionally with IMF data.

  - Dynamic critical cross-over latitudes for transition between
    dynamo and empirical models at high-latitude.

  - New diagnostics module (diags.F).  22 "sanctioned" diagnostic fields 
    are available, and can be saved on secondary histories 
    (see diags.table in doc directory).

  - HPSS archive script can be saved by the model, to be executed after 
    a run to save history files to the NCAR HPSS with "contents" annotations.

New build system (scripts directory):
  - Make.machine files contain platform and machine-specific compiler
    and link options, library locations, etc. are available in scripts directory.
  - New Makefile without platform-dependent conditionals.
  - Support for Intel ifort/mpif90 compiler on 64-bit HAO Linux systems
    (Intel-built code significantly faster than PGI-built code on systems
     with Intel hardware)
  - Write svnversion to history files.

  - tgcm_contents	Print "contents" (annotations) of history files
  - tgcm_ncdump		Print ncdump of history files, w/ data for scalars and 1d vectors
  - tgcm_put		Archive history files on the NCAR HPSS system

Validation and benchmark runs (new tests directory):
  - Setup scripts for benchmark runs are available in the tests directory
  - The following benchmark runs have been performed with the current version:
      o Seasonal start-up histories at smin, smax.
      o One-year climatology run (Heelis potential with constant solar forcing)
      o December, 2006 "AGU storm" case (Weimer/IMF and Heelis/GPI runs)
      o November, 2003 storm case
      o Whole-Heliosphere Interval (WHI)
  - Results of the benchmark runs are available on the NCAR Community Data Portal

Changes to namelist inputs:
  - Weimer potential model with IMF data from IMF_NCFILE, and F10.7 data
    from GPI_NCFILE
  - HPSS_PATH specifies destination path to the NCAR HPSS, for history file 
    archive script. (All references to the old NCAR MSS have been removed) 
  - Time-dependent namelist option for F107a and F107d 
  - The following namelist parameters are deprecated: SAVE, SECSAVE, DISPOSE

Msc:
  - Changed units of f107d, f107a, ctpoten, and hpower on the histories.
  - Divide by avogadro's number instead of multiplying by 1.66e-24 in
    sub calczg (addiag.F).
