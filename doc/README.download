                Also available from tgcm website: http://www.hao.ucar.edu/modeling/tgcm

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These instructions assume the gzipped tar file of the Source Code has
been downloaded from the above URL. After the file is gunzipped 
and the tar file extracted to a working directory, you should have 
something like the following:

README		Brief description of directories
doc/		Documentation		User Guide, Model Description, Release Doc
scripts/	Support scripts 	Job scripts, Make files, Utilities
src/		Source code		Source files *.F, *.h
tests/		Benchmark tests		Scripts for benchmark runs

To build and run the model, you must also download the data directory
from the above URL, or already have the data in a directory specified
by the $TGCMDATA env var.

>>> IMPORTANT <<<
If you download the data directory, please set environment variable TGCMDATA 
to the full path to the data directory (setenv in your .cshrc file).  This is to 
enable the model to resolve $TGCMDATA if it is used in the model namelist input file)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Follow this procedure to build the model and make a short default run on a Linux system.

1. Copy the csh job script scripts/tiegcm-linux.job to your working directory.
   This default job script is for a 64-bit Linux system with MPI, using 4 processors.

2. Make sure your env var $TGCMDATA is set to a directory containing files
   obtained from the data download (check setting of SOURCE file in doc/tiegcm_default.inp)

3. Execute the job script in background by typing "tiegcm-linux.job &"
   (or submit the script to a batch queing system)

4. The model will be built and executed in the execution directory tiegcm-linux
   (or possibly tiegcmx.xx-linux for version x.xx). A default namelist input
   tiegcm_default.inp file will be created. NetCDF output files will also be written
   to the execution directory. Stdout from the model run will be written to
   tiegcm.out in your working directory.

5. For subsequent runs, rename and edit the default namelist input file (tiegcm_default.inp)
   and set the "input" shell variable to the new input file name in the job script. 
   (If "set input" is commented out in the job script, it will always make and use 
    the default file, ignoring other files that may be in the working directory)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following "Make.machine" files are available in the scripts directory.
These contain platform and machine-specific compiler and link flags, library
locations, etc. Select the Make.machine file you want to use, and set the
"make" shell variable in the job script.

  Make.bluefire		NCAR IBM cluster "bluefire" with AIX and xlf90 compiler
  Make.generic_dasg	For serial test runs on NCAR DASG machines (e.g., mirage0)
  Make.intel_hao64	Intel ifort/mpif90 compiler on 64-bit HAO Linux systems
  Make.pgi_hao64	PGI pgf90/mpif90 compiler on 64-bit HAO Linux systems
  Make.pgi_hao32	PGI pgf90 compiler on 32-bit HAO Linux systems (usually serial)

User's are encouraged to customize their own Make.machine files for their
local systems. For the job script to use the file, the "make" shell variable  
should be set to the file name (can be in the working directory or the scripts directory

The model has been built and executed on the following platforms:

-- NCAR IBM/AIX bluefire (parallel MPI) (xlf90 build):
   AIX be1105en 3 5 00CBB5014C00

-- 64-bit Linux (parallel MPI, PGI's pgf90 compiler) e.g.:
   Linux arc 2.6.18-128.7.1.el5 #1 SMP Mon Aug 24 08:21:56 EDT 2009 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

-- 64-bit Linux (parallel MPI, Intel ifort compiler) e.g.:
   Linux arc 2.6.18-128.7.1.el5 #1 SMP Mon Aug 24 08:21:56 EDT 2009 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

-- "Generic" NCAR/HAO fc7 32-bit Linux desktop (serial), (pgf90 build) e.g.:
   Linux oreo 2.6.23.17-88.fc7 #1 SMP Thu May 15 00:35:10 EDT 2008 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux

-- Linux Ubuntu with Intel ifort/mpif90 compiler.
