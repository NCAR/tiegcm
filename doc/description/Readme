am 2/7/05 /home/maute/teTex.d/TIEGCM_DYNAMO
  for documentation of the electrodynamo part of TIEGCM
  
  on 2/7/04 copied source code from /suncat/e/maute/tiegcm_pg_paper
   -> directory src_orig (is the unmodified code)
   -> directory src (is the modified code which is documented)
   
   run test cases to see what the changes effect
  
am 3/31/05 
   - code moved into TIEGCM by Ben Foster
   - move the source code from callisto into home directory
      /home/maute/teTex.d/TIEGCM_DYNAMO/
      src : modified TIEGCM1.6 with my mods documented & corrected
      src_orig: modified TIEGCM1.6 with my mods
      merge_w1.7: TIEGCM1.7 with my mods
         note that other mods are added to TIEGCM1.7 afterwards
	 
   - code and test cases can be found at
      mss:/MAUTE/TIEGCM_1.7DEV (s. merge_w1.7/Readme)
      tested on bluesky, lightning, V1.6 and V1.7

am 6/8/05
   - modsrc_1.8dev:  modsrc to /home/tgcm/dev/tiegcm1.8/src
     correct the calculation of Joule heating for the ion
     temperature subroutine qjoule_ti
     before
       Q_JI = [ lambda_xx * u_i(u_i-u_n) + lambda_yy*v_i*(v_i-v_n)]
     should be
       Q_JI = m_n/(m_n+m_i) * [ lambda_xx * (u_i-u_n)^2 + lambda_yy*(v_i-v_n)^2]
     the part for the neutral temperature is not changing
     since it also includes the energy transfered from the ion to the neutrals
     and therefore is
       Q_J = [ lambda_xx * (u_i-u_n)^2 + lambda_yy*(v_i-v_n)^2]
           = Q_JI + Q_JN
       Q_JN Joule heating going into the neutrals

am June 08 
 merged dynamo and general tiegcm description
 
am  8 July 08
  moved into /home/tgcm/doc/description
   
  work in there from now on     
  included an index
  
am 21 July 08
  got description from Wenbin Wang
  magnetospheric inputs
  put into directory  get_documents 
  incorporated the script from Wenbbin
  -> tiegcm_modeldes_23july08.pdf
  notes see get_documents/notes_wenbin
  new files: 
  magsphere_input.tex
  filter.tex
  
am 23 July 08
  get Hanli changes neutral dynamics
  put into directory  get_documents
  notes see get_documents/notes_hanli
  new files: 
  neutraldyn.tex
  -> tiegcm_modeldes_23july08.pdf

am 24 July
   include Hanli's handwritten changes to the neutral dynamics
   notation.tex
   addiag.F
   divrg.tex
   duv.tex
   
* Anyway, can you check the z,Z problem.
* Horizontal diffusion is included (I had it in my notes, but didn't document
the hdif.F file) I just put in a comment there and included it in the RHS of the
discretizied eqn..
* Spectral filtering is done when for Un and Vn is solved, not intermittently.
It was already in the description. In between a Shapiro  smoother is used for the
neutral winds at the old timestep (already documented)
* The equation (5.22) I had a question mark in my notes too. I changed it so that it makes sense
and is conform with the code.

am 17 Nov 08
  update F value in current.F equ (6.9) from Richmond 95 sinI/sinI_m
  in the document it was sinI_m/sinI   

am 18 Nov 08
  corrected next equation which uses F from sinI/sinI_m to sinI_m/sinI
  
am 19 Nov 08
  corrected eq. (7.190) J_e2/D = 
  Tzu-Wei pointed out it must be Ed1+ue2Be3 in stead of Ed1-ue2Be3  

am 4/2/09 include Alan Burns cahnges to duv.F, cpktkm.tex and dt.F
   files for changes in directory get_documents:
