 magsphere_input.tex 
 filter.tex
 
* index terms (add or remove s. index page)
* chapter numbering is not logical in the script
* under Weimer table with heelis input
* figures produced eps figures, let me know if you have originals or if the ones
  I produced are fine
* check references to figures, literature, equations
  I automated them.
* check notation (put in the notation section, try to be conistent, also we 
   other chapters)
* equation 2.115 double chi_e or chi_h  ?
* reference missing: Fontheim et al., 1987; 
   Heikkila and Winningham, 1971
   Hardy et al., 1985; Candidi and Meng, 1984; Sotirelis et al., 1997;
   Hardy et al., 1986; Riehl and Hardy, 1986; Gussenhoven et al., 1984; 
   Winningham and Heikkila, 1974; Newell and Meng, 
   1990, Meng and Kroehl, 1977; Roble and Rees, 1977; Lazarev (1967)
   (if possible give them to me like in main.bib, the once you already gave to
   me I included)
* reference to section 2.4.2 which is not in the script
  (chapter cusp electron precipitation)
* assume units in e.g. eq. 2.123 is eV/(cm^2 s)
* left out Barb's part (s. wiki site) since this needs to be incorporated into the other text.
  It's partly redundant, new etc.
  So somebody has to go over it, before I put time into converting it to latex.
*  notation not consistent phi sometimes latitude, longitude...
  if possible we should stick to the same names for basic quantities.
