\section{Input to the Electrodynamo}\label{cap:input2electro}
%
%
In \src{subroutine prep-dynamo} fields are prepared for the electrodynamo
calculation. The preparation includes reversing the order of the indexing, as
well as gathering the fields from the different processors to the master
processor. The electrodynamo part is still serial and therefore a gathering
of all the subdomains at
the beginning and
a distribution of the fields to all the subdomains at the end has to be done.

The input to \src{subroutine prep-dynamo} is summarized in table
\ref{tab:input_prepdynamo}.

To calculate the vertical neutral velocity $w_n$ the pressure scale
height H in [$cm$] is determined at first, assuming hydrostatic
equilibrium for timescales longer than a few minutes.
%
\begin{equation}
    H = \frac{R^* T_n}{\overline{m}g}
\end{equation}
%
with $R^*$ the gas constant in [$\frac{erg}{mole K}$], $T_n$ the
neutral temperature in [$K$], $\overline{m}$ the mean molecular mass
in [$\frac{g}{mole}$] and $g$ acceleration of gravity in
[$\frac{cm}{s^2}$]. The dimensionless vertical wind W is
%
\begin{equation}
    W = -\frac{1}{p} \frac{dp}{dt}
\end{equation}
%
which is used to get the vertical wind at a constant pressure level
by
%
\begin{equation}
    w_n = H W
\end{equation}
%
with the pressure $p$ and $\frac{dp}{dt}$ the time rate of change following the fluid
motion.
