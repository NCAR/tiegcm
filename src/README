10/21/04: Changed #include statements from "file.h" to <file.h>.
Used perl /home/foster/tgcm/scripts/change_incs_bracks.

10/29/04:
Small change to print format statement in advance.F.
Fixed dispose.F to correct password problem in mscomment (see save/dispose.old)

!-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1/10/05:
Copied source from /home/tgcm/tiegcm1.6/src and scripts from ~/tgcm/scripts.
Modifying source for lightning linux cluster, like ~/tgcm/timegcm/src.
This is currently not a CVS working directory -- CVS working directory
is ~/tiegcm/tiegcm, but this dir (from /home/tgcm/tiegcm/src) is more
up to date. At some point (when code is working on lightning), this
should become the CVS working dir.

1/10/05:
Removed nc_xxxx routines from nchist.F, replacing them with the netcdf
functions nf_xxxx. The routine nc_get_var_real (nf_get_var_double) was
being used incorrectly (getting scalar when var is a vector with time
dimension). Now using nf_get_var1_double to get scalar at time itime. 
(see, e.g., reading f107a, f107d, etc). Same for ints that are dimensioned
in time.

1/11/05:
Determined that -fastsse does not work for dynamo (problem w/ rhs).
So mpif90 optimization should be -O2 -fast.

1/12/05:
Cleaning up for lighting: added shutdown routine (util.F), and several
other routines in util.F. Changed output, nchist, etc so that disk
file names can be used for SOURCE, OUTPUT, or SECOUT.

Changed some dimensions to avoid out-of-bounds check by the compiler.
Can now use -g -C to check for out-of-bounds. (see esp, dynamo.F, where
array() was changed to wkarray(), and put in module data).

Removed "old" dynamo option (dynamo_old.F). Now the namelist read parameter
DYNAMO <= 0 -> no dynamo, or
DYNAMO >  0 -> dynamo ("new" only)

tempdir can now be blank (which has same effect as tempdir==.).
