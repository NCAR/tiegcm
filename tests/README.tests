This is the $modeldir/tests directory of a TIEGCM model release, where
$modeldir is the root directory of the release (version tiegcm1.94 or later).
The model root directory may be obtained by downloading and extracting the 
model "Source Code" tar file from the TIEGCM download page:

http://www.hao.ucar.edu/modeling/tgcm/download.php

This tests/ directory contains subdirectories for test/validation runs 
of the model. Each subdirectory contains namelist input files and job
scripts to build the model and execute the test simulation.

To make these runs, you will need model start-up history files as
specified in the namelist input files. For example, the start-up
file for the climatology run is specified as:

SOURCE = '$TGCMDATA/tiegcm1.94/climatology/TGCM.tiegcm1.94.pclim_heelis_001.nc'

These start-up source files are available by downloading and extracting
the model Data tar file. This download is available at the above TIEGCM
download page.

For full results of the benchmark runs, history files are available at the
NCAR Community Data Portal at http://cdp.ucar.edu (go to "Models" and then 
"Thermospheric General Circulation Models").

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following is a brief description of each benchmark test run.
More detailed information is available in SUMMARY files in each 
subdirectory.

climatology/
  Full year climatology run with constant solar forcing and the Heelis
  Potential Model.

control/
  5-day control runs started from steady-state histories at the two 
  equinoxes and the two solstices. Run sets are made for solar minimum
  conditions (F10.7=70) and for solar maximum conditions (F10.7=200).

dec2006/
  December, 2006 "AGU Storm" simulation: days 330-360 of 2006.
  There are runs with the Heelis potential model, and the Weimer
  potential model.

nov2003/
  November, 2003 storm case, following the well-known "Halloween" storm.
  This simulation is for November 1-6 (days 305-310) of 2003.
  (runs with Heelis and Weimer potential models)

whi2008/
  Whole Helisophere Interval, March 21 to April 16 (days 81-106) 
  of 2003 (runs with Heelis and Weimer potential models)
