11/8/2002:

Latest version of TIEGCM, tiegcm1. Fixed source is in hao /home/tgcm/tiegcm1,
including tar file tiegcm1_src.tar.Z.

Default resolution: 5x5 degree horizontal, 0.5 Zp vertical. See defs.h to
set alternate resolutions in both horizontal and vertical.

This code uses a 2d domain decomposition in latitude and longitude.
The parallelization is distributed memory MPI only. Recommended number
of processors for production runs is 32 (8 4-processor nodes).

This model includes the new dynamo (set DYNAMO=2 in namelist input).

To build and execute batch jobs:
  1. Copy *.inp and *.job files from /home/tgcm/tiegcm1.
  2. Modify input and job files for the desired run.
  3. Submit to remote machine using "submit file.job" (submit script is
     in hao /home/tgcm/bld/submit) 

To build and execute interactively:
  1. Extract the source tar file (tiegcm1_src.tar) in an empty directory.
  2. Execute "perl mkdep" to make dependencies for Makefile.
  3. For non-ncar systems (without mass store): 
      a. Remove -DMSS from FFLAGS in Makefile.
      b. Put SOURCE history and MAGVOL netcdf files in execution directory,
         and specify their names in the namelist input file (tiegcm1.inp).
  4. Run "gmake" or "gnumake" to compile.
  5. Use "tiegcm1 < tiegcm1.inp" to execute, or whatever command is
     appropriate for MPI runs (e.g., mpirun, prun, etc).

A copy of the source (with Makefile) is on the NCAR mss in
/TGCM/tiegcm1/tiegcm1_src.tar.Z. Object and binaries are NOT saved,
so the code needs to be completely built before execution.

8/20/03: Changed /home/tgcm/tiegcm1/input.F to fix bug that occurred
when no secondary histories were requested. See also modsrc/README.

8/28/03: Fix bug in addfsechik_geo (addfsech_ik.F) in which k-loop
must be used instead of :'s.
