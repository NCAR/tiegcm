Model:		TIEGCM
Svn Tag:	tiegcm2.0
Release Date:	March, 2016

Source and data tar files to build and execute the model can
be downloaded from the TGCM download website. You will be
asked to provide an email address, but no password is necessary.

http://www.hao.ucar.edu/modeling/tgcm/download.php

These 3 tar files are available for download:
  tiegcm2.0.tar             # source code of exported svn tag (30 MB)
  tiegcm_res5.0_data.tar    # startup and data files for 5.0-deg model (1.5 GB)
  tiegcm_res2.5_data.tar    # startup and data files for 2.5-deg model (4 GB)

Download and extract these files into a large temporary disk space 
(you can download only the data tarball for the resolution you want). 
To download the source file, the 5-degree data file, and make a default
run, you will need about 1.8G of disk. For the 2.5-deg data and default
run, you will need about 5.3G.

Extracting these 3 tar files will result in directories of the same name.
In addition, the source file (tiegcm2.0.tar) also contains the following
default job scripts and namelist input files:

  tiegcm-linux.job          # job script for 64-bit Linux desktop
  tiegcm-ys.job             # job script for NCAR supercomputer "yellowstone"
  tiegcm_res5.0.inp         # default namelist input file for 5.0-deg resolution model
  tiegcm_res2.5.inp         # default namelist input file for 2.5-deg resolution model

At this point you should be able to execute the job script appropriate
to the system you are running on by simply typing the name on the command line.
The job script will build the model, and execute a default 5-deg run. The job 
scripts can be easily modified to make a 2.5-degree run (read the comments at 
the top of the job scripts).

By default, output history files will be created in the execution directory (execdir)
