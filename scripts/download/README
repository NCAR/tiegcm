Shell script to tar source and data files for download from the 
download page on the tgcm website: 

http://www.hao.ucar.edu/modeling/tgcm/download.php

See $source_home and $data_home in make_downloads for locations
of the source and data directories to be tarballed.

You will need at least 5.5G disk to download all files and make
a default 5-deg run. This is normally executed in a scratch or
project directory on yellowstone (or whatever current NCAR Super).

Execute make_downloads in this directory to create 3 tar files:
(these will extract into directories of the same name)
  tiegcm2.0.tar            # The svn tag (src, scripts, doc, etc)
  tiegcm_res2.5_data.tar   # startup and data files for 2.5-deg resolution
  tiegcm_res5.0_data.tar   # startup and data files for 5.0-deg resolution

The following files are also included in the source file (tiegcm2.0.tar):
  README.download     # Instructions to the user
  tiegcm-linux.job    # Default Linux job script
  tiegcm-ys.job       # Default yellowstone script
  tiegcm_res2.5.inp   # Default 2.5-deg resolution namelist input
  tiegcm_res5.0.inp   # Default 5.0-deg resolution namelist input

The 3 tar files can be copied to webpub for the above download page.

After download and extraction, the user should be able to execute the 
job script appropriate for the system in use, to build the model and 
execute a default 5-deg run. The job scripts can be modified to make 
2.5-deg runs, which will access startup and data files in tiegcm_res2.5_data.
