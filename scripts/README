Under Linux, the CPPFLAGS were repeated twice in each compilation 
statement.  Apparently, under linux, gmake includes both CPPFLAGS 
and FFLAGS in the target execution statement. This is not the case 
under AIX and SGI, where gmake apparently includes only FFLAGS.
Removing CPPFLAGS from the FFLAGS definition in Linux sections of
the Makefile cleaned this up.

2/2/05: 
Importing to CVS as new project "tgcm_scripts".
This is after tiegcm-linux-mpi.job and timegcm-linux-mpi.job, but
before removing reference to blackforest and dave.

2/2: Removed references to blackforest and dave, and committed
to repository. Also updated scripts directories for all models
under TGCMROOT at hao and scd (using the distribute scripts).

The distribute command was used from /home/tgcm/scripts at hao,
and from /fis/hao/tgcm/scripts at scd. This included job files
for lightning, and changes for lightning in other scripts.

3/28/05: Changed MkNamelist for section on tiegcm: DYNAMO is now
either 1 or 0 for dynamo or no-dynamo.

4/6/05:
Changes to MkNamelist and tgcm_config for Liying's SEE data file
for tiegcm1.8. This has new namelist parameter SD_FILE. Put a default
SD_FILE in $TGCMDATA (both hao and scd). This default file
($TGCMDATA/see__L3_merged_2005007_007.nc) is now copied to exec dif
by tgcm_config. The new namelist parameter is added to tiegcm section
of MkNamelist. The new files MkNamelist and tgcm_config were distributed
to model scripts directories at both hao and scd.

4/22/05: In MkNamelist, for all most recent versions of both models , 
DYNAMO is 1 or 0 for or dynamo no-dynamo.
