Under Linux, the CPPFLAGS were repeated twice in each compilation 
statement.  Apparently, under linux, gmake includes both CPPFLAGS 
and FFLAGS in the target execution statement. This is not the case 
under AIX and SGI, where gmake apparently includes only FFLAGS.
Removing CPPFLAGS from the FFLAGS definition in Linux sections of
the Makefile cleaned this up.
