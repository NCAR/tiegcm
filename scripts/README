These were copied directly from $TGCMROOT/dev/tiegcm1-8tune2/scripts,
then tiegcm-ibm.job and MkDispose were changed to allow submission to
bluevista as well as bluesky.

To submit to bluesky, use LoadLeveler command "llsubmit tiegcm-ibm.job"

To submit to bluevista, use LSF command "bsub < tiegcm-ibm.job" 

6/27/06 btf:
Added "#BSUB -n 1" to MkDispose to satisfy new LSF on bluevista.

10/4/06 btf:
Added the following to *ibm.job and MkDispose:

##
## 10/4/06 btf:
## As of Nov 6, 2006, scd is requiring explicit project numbers
## on all LSF jobs. I am including 28100036 here, but users who
## are not authorized on this project will have to change it.
##
#BSUB -P 28100036

11/29/06: Added following env vars in tiegcm-ibm.job. These were
suggested by Siddhartha:

if ($nodename =~ bv*) then # bluevista
  setenv MP_STDINMODE 0
  setenv MP_SHARED_MEMORY yes
  setenv MEMORY_AFFINITY MCM
  setenv AIXTHREAD_SCOPE S
  setenv MALLOCMULTIHEAP true
endif

Also added examples of how to use SMT on bluevista:

#
#BSUB -n 48                 # 48 procs
#BSUB -R "span[ptile=16]"   # 3 nodes w/ SMT (Symmetric Multi-Threading)
#
##BSUB -n 32                # 32 procs
##BSUB -R "span[ptile=16]"  # 2 nodes w/ SMT
#

1/3/07:
Changed Makefile to specify -L/usr/local/lib64/r4i4 -lmss because
mpxlf_r was using /usr/local/lib32/r4i4, which is incorrect on bluevista.

2/13/07: Eliminate dcs and mss libs from Makefile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
10/25/07:
Update from $TGCMROOT/tiegcm1.8/scripts and commit to cvs.

11/7/07:
Changed lib_netcdf for AIX in tgcm_config from /usr/local/lib32/r4i4
to /usr/local/lib (the lib32/r4i4 dir does not exist on blueice).
